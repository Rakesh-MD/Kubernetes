Step 2: Label the Worker Nodes
Use the kubectl label command to assign a role to the worker nodes. For example:

bash
Copy code
kubectl label node worker1 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=
kubectl label node worker2 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=
The label key is node-role.kubernetes.io/worker.
The = at the end ensures the value is empty, which Kubernetes interprets as a role assignment.


Notes:
Role Names Are Informational: Kubernetes does not enforce any behavior based on these roles. They are used primarily for organization and display purposes.

Control Plane Roles: The control plane node is automatically assigned the role control-plane. If it's not visible, you can explicitly set it using:

bash
Copy code
kubectl label node controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=
Worker Role Customization: If you want a custom role, you can replace worker with your desired role, e.g., node-role.kubernetes.io/storage= or node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=.

This way, you can organize your nodes with meaningful roles!
